# 3D Art Gallery

## Project Overview

A modern, interactive art gallery web application that showcases digital artwork in a virtual gallery space. Visitors can navigate the gallery, view artwork details, zoom and rotate art pieces, and enjoy ambient lighting and camera transitions. 

## Key Features

* Immersive 3D gallery environment (walkthrough/camera navigation)
* Artwork cards with metadata (title, artist, year, medium, description)
* Zoom, rotate and inspect 3D art pieces or hi-res images
* Ambient lighting and environment map for realism
* Responsive layout (desktop/tablet/mobile support)
* Search, filter and categorize artworks
* Performance optimizations: lazy loading, LODs, compressed textures

## Tech Stack (common choices — adjust to match the real repo)

* Frontend: React (Vite / Next.js / Create React App)
* 3D library: three.js or react-three-fiber (R3F)
* Models / Assets: glTF / GLB, JPG/PNG, HDR environment maps
* Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components
* State management: React Context, Zustand, or Redux (optional)
* Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting

## Local Setup

> These are general steps — update commands to match the actual project scripts.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# or using yarn
# yarn install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

4. Open the app in your browser

```
http://localhost:3000
# or the port shown by the dev server
```

## Production Build & Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# serve the built files (example)
npm run preview
```

Deploy to Vercel / Netlify by connecting the repository and following the platform-specific instructions.

└── README.md
```

## Usage Guide

* Navigate the gallery using mouse/trackpad or touch gestures.
* Click an artwork to open a details panel with full metadata and zoom controls.
* Use search and filters to find works by artist, year, or medium.
* If curator/admin features exist, log in to manage artwork entries.

## Optimizations & Notes

* Use compressed texture formats (KTX2/ Basis) to reduce load times.
* Implement progressive loading for large models (placeholder low-poly mesh).
* Add fallbacks for devices that don't support WebGL.
* Consider accessibility: keyboard navigation, alt descriptions for artworks.
