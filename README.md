# 3D Art Gallery

> README for the 3D Art Gallery web application

## Project Overview

A modern, interactive 3D art gallery web application that showcases digital artwork in a virtual gallery space. Visitors can navigate the gallery, view artwork details, zoom and rotate art pieces, and enjoy ambient lighting and camera transitions. This README was prepared based on the provided project link; if the live site is private or unavailable, treat this as a template README that you can adapt.

## Key Features

* Immersive 3D gallery environment (walkthrough/camera navigation)
* Artwork cards with metadata (title, artist, year, medium, description)
* Zoom, rotate and inspect 3D art pieces or hi-res images
* Ambient lighting and environment map for realism
* Responsive layout (desktop/tablet/mobile support)
* Optional VR / WebXR support (if enabled)
* Search, filter and categorize artworks
* Admin or curator panel to add, edit or remove artworks (if included)
* Performance optimizations: lazy loading, LODs, compressed textures

## Tech Stack (common choices — adjust to match the real repo)

* Frontend: React (Vite / Next.js / Create React App)
* 3D library: three.js or react-three-fiber (R3F)
* Models / Assets: glTF / GLB, JPG/PNG, HDR environment maps
* Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components
* State management: React Context, Zustand, or Redux (optional)
* Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting

## Local Setup

> These are general steps — update commands to match the actual project scripts.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# or using yarn
# yarn install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

4. Open the app in your browser

```
http://localhost:3000
# or the port shown by the dev server
```

## Production Build & Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# serve the built files (example)
npm run preview
```

Deploy to Vercel / Netlify by connecting the repository and following the platform-specific instructions.

```

## Usage Guide

* Navigate the gallery using mouse/trackpad or touch gestures.
* Click an artwork to open a details panel with full metadata and zoom controls.
* Use search and filters to find works by artist, year, or medium.
* If curator/admin features exist, log in to manage artwork entries.

## Optimizations & Notes

* Use compressed texture formats (KTX2/ Basis) to reduce load times.
* Implement progressive loading for large models (placeholder low-poly mesh).
* Add fallbacks for devices that don't support WebGL.
* Consider accessibility: keyboard navigation, alt descriptions for artworks.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/awesome`)
3. Commit your changes and push
4. Open a pull request describing your changes

## Troubleshooting

* If the gallery shows a blank canvas: check the browser console for WebGL or shader errors.
* If assets fail to load: verify correct paths in `public/` and check CORS settings for external assets.

### NOTE

I attempted to access the provided link to generate this README automatically, but the page appears to be private or returned minimal content. This README is therefore a thorough template you can use or adapt to match the actual project's files and commands. If you want, I can update this README to exactly match the repository if you share the repo contents or grant access to the live site.
